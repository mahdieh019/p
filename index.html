                Google was founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D.
                students at Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14 percent of 
                its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock.
                They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998.
